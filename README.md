# oq_model_explorer

Openquake model explorer.

# Info
This is some python code to _visualize_, _analyze_ and _simplify_ Openquake models. Since some functionality that is not meant to be published here has been removed without further adjustments, the current state of the code is broken.

Dependencies include:

* openquake
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* matplotlib.

# Disclaimer
This project is in no way affiliated with GEM. It just uses some Openquake code.
Don't expect it to be useful yet! The code does not run in this state, since a lot of code that can not be published has been removed.
It still needs to be refactored to a model-visualization-only tool.
